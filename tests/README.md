# AI4Thai Crop Guardian - Test System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test system implementation for the AI4Thai Crop Guardian platform, designed to ensure quality, reliability, and security across all components.

## Test Pyramid Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (70%)
- **Scope**: Individual functions, methods, and components
- **Technologies**: Rust (cargo test), Python (pytest), JavaScript (Jest)
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+
- **Execution**: Fast (< 10 seconds total)

### 2. Integration Tests (20%)
- **Scope**: Service-to-service communication
- **Technologies**: Docker Compose, TestContainers
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+
- **Execution**: Medium (< 2 minutes)

### 3. End-to-End Tests (10%)
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows
- **Technologies**: Playwright, Selenium
- **Coverage Target**: Critical paths
- **Execution**: Slow (< 10 minutes)

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API contracts
- End-to-end user journey tests
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

### Non-Functional Testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### Quality Assurance
- Code coverage analysis
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking

## Test Environments

1. **Local Development**: Developer workstation testing
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on every commit/PR
3. **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
4. **Production**: Production monitoring and health checks

## Quality Gates

Tests must pass before code can be:
1. Committed (pre-commit hooks)
2. Merged to main branch (CI/CD pipeline)
3. Deployed to staging (automated deployment)
4. Deployed to production (manual approval + automated checks)

## Metrics and Reporting

### Coverage Metrics
- Line coverage: > 90%
- Branch coverage: > 85%
- Function coverage: > 95%

### Quality Metrics
- Test execution time: < 10 minutes total
- Test flakiness: < 1%
- Bug escape rate: < 5%
- Mean time to detection: < 24 hours
