## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Rust Code
- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/)
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Write comprehensive documentation comments

```rust
/// Detects diseases in crop images using machine learning models.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `image_data` - The image data as bytes
/// * `crop_type` - The type of crop being analyzed
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// A `Result` containing the disease detection results or an error
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// let result = detect_disease(&image_data, CropType::Rice).await?;
/// println!("Detected diseases: {:?}", result.diseases);
/// ```
pub async fn detect_disease(
    image_data: &[u8], 
    crop_type: CropType
) -> Result<DetectionResult, DetectionError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Python Code
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `flake8` for linting
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes

```python
def process_image(image_path: str, crop_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process crop image for disease detection.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the image file
        crop_type: Type of crop ('rice', 'cassava', etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing detection results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image_path is invalid
        ProcessingError: If image processing fails
        
    Example:
        >>> result = process_image('crop.jpg', 'rice')
        >>> print(result['diseases'])
    """
    # Implementation
```

#### Frontend Code (Yew/Rust)
- Use consistent component structure
- Implement proper error handling
- Write unit tests for components
- Follow accessibility guidelines

```rust
#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct CropImageProps {
    pub image_url: String,
    pub alt_text: String,
    pub on_click: Callback<MouseEvent>,
}

#[function_component(CropImage)]
pub fn crop_image(props: &CropImageProps) -> Html {
    let onclick = {
        let on_click = props.on_click.clone();
        Callback::from(move |e: MouseEvent| {
            on_click.emit(e);
        })
    };

    html! {
        <img 
            src={props.image_url.clone()}
            alt={props.alt_text.clone()}
            onclick={onclick}
            class="crop-image"
            role="button"
            tabindex="0"
        />
    }
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all public functions
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_detect_disease_with_valid_rice_image() {
        // Arrange
        let image_data = load_test_image("rice_blast.jpg");
        let crop_type = CropType::Rice;

        // Act
        let result = detect_disease(&image_data, crop_type).await;

        // Assert
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        let detection = result.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(detection.diseases.len(), 1);
        assert_eq!(detection.diseases[0].name, "Rice Blast");
        assert!(detection.diseases[0].confidence > 0.8);
    }
}
```

#### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Test service interactions
- Use test databases and mock external services

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_disease_detection_endpoint():
    """Test the disease detection API endpoint."""
    with open("test_images/rice_blast.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
        response = client.post(
            "/detect",
            files={"image": ("rice_blast.jpg", image_file, "image/jpeg")},
            data={"crop_type": "rice"}
        )
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "diseases" in data
    assert len(data["diseases"]) > 0
    assert data["diseases"][0]["confidence"] > 0.8
```
